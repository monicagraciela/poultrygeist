 # You'll Be Running Chicken...

Basically you're at an immoral poultry farm where they were trying to get really big eggs.
Big eggs sell for big money.

The problem is that they made giant, mutant chickens to make big eggs. Unfortunately they got out and  you are an animal right's activist trying to discover the truth.

Instead of dreams they were after eggs.

Will you discover the truth? Will you even escape with your life?
